# Wheat_Disease_Classifier - Kaggle Dataset

This project aimed to create a CNN capable of accurately classifying 15 diseases commonly found in wheat crops. This idea stemmed from my background as a Juniour Wheat Breeder, and general interest in agriculture. A medium sized Kaggle Image Dataset was available, and despite a few issues, was a good dataset to undertake this project.

**Final Test Accuracy:** ...

## Project Structure
- 'Wheat_Disease_Classifier.ipynb': Porject Notebook written in Google Colab
- 'requirements.txt': Requirements to run project notebook

## Key Findings
- Initial attempts to create and train CNN from scrathc proved limited.
- Transfer learning using MobileNetV2 far more effective
- CNN achieved good accuracy from dataset of ~14,000 images
- Further improvement still I believe is possible

This was a challenging project with someone of my experience, but an enjoyable one. A lot of learning and determination but very happy with the current outcome.
