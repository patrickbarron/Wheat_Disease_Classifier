# Wheat_Disease_Classifier - Kaggle Dataset

This project aimed to create a CNN capable of accurately classifying 15 diseases commonly found in wheat crops. This idea stemmed from my background as a Juniour Wheat Breeder, and general interest in agriculture. A medium sized Kaggle Image Dataset was available (Approx 14,000 images, and despite a few issues, was a good dataset to undertake this project.

**Model_V1 Final Test Accuracy:** 84.26%

## Project Structure
- 'Wheat_Disease_Classifier.ipynb': Project Notebook written in Google Colab
- 'requirements.txt': Requirements to run project notebook

## Key Findings
- Initial attempts to create and train CNN from scratch proved limited.
- Transfer learning using MobileNetV2 far more effective
- CNN achieved good accuracy from dataset of ~14,000 images
- Further improvement still I believe is possible

This was a challenging project with someone of my experience, but an enjoyable one. A lot of learning and determination but very happy with the current outcome. I intend to build further on the model to try and improve the accuracy further.
